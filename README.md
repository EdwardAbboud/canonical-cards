In this repository you can find all the files for the cards assignment for Canonical.

the main file to run is the index.html

Reasoning:
The assignment was too basic to use a framework (i.e. React). I created a basic setup for fetching the data from the API, a creator function for injecting HTML into the DOM and finally the index.js which will run all the needed files to create the cards.

If there are any questions please feel free to reach out to me.
